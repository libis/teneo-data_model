		<fdd:description>
			<p>The ESRI Shapefile format was developed by Esri, formerly the Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. and abbreviated as "ESRI," and published in 1998.  Although proprietary, the intention behind publishing the format was to encourage its use for interoperability among geographic information system (GIS) applications. The Shapefile format stores nontopological geometry and attribute information for spatial features in a data set.  A Shapefile consists minimally of a main file, an index file, and a dBASE  table.</p>
			<p>In the main file, the geometry for a feature is stored as a shape comprising a set of vector coordinates.  This main file is a direct access, variable-record-length file in which each record describes a shape with a list of its vertices.  In the index file, each record contains the offset of the corresponding main file record from the beginning of the main file.  Attributes are held in a dBASE format file.  The dBASE table contains feature attributes with one record per feature.  Attribute records in the dBASE file must be in the same order as records in the main file.    Each attribute record has a one-to-one relationship with the associated shape record. </p>
			<p>The shapefile format can support point, line, and area features.  Area features are represented as closed loop, double-digitized polygons.</p>
			<p>Instances of the Shapefile format have often been used as a data exchange format from Esri formats to non-Esri applications.  The format is most useful for writing simple features and attributes quickly as there are limitations inherent in the Shapefile format related to both geometry and attributes.  As outlined elsewhere in this description, these limitations may cause loss of data when using shapefiles to contain or exchange complex geometry or attributes.  The Shapefile format may be used as an intermediary between data creation applications and more functionally capable GIS formats and applications, albeit with the limitations noted in the Dataset/Normal Dataset section.</p>
			<p>The cluster of files is typically stored in the same file directory or project workspace, with all component files having the same filename (prefix) and identified by individual file extension (suffixes).  Three components are mandatory: a main file that contains the feature geometry (.shp), an index file that stores the index of the feature geometry (.shx), and a dBASE table (.dbf) that stores the attribute information of features.  A comprehensive list of component files follows: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<i>shp</i> -- Main file (mandatory); a direct access, variable-record-length file in which each record describes a shape
with a list of its vertices. </li>
				<li>
					<i>shx</i> -- Index file (mandatory).  In the index file, each record contains the offset of the
corresponding main file record from the beginning of the main file. The index file (.shx) contains a 100-byte header followed by 8-byte, fixed-length records.</li>
				<li>
					<i>dbf</i> -- dBASE Table file (mandatory); a constrained form of <fddLink id="fdd000325">DBF</fddLink> that contains feature attributes with one record per feature. The one-to-one relationship
between geometry and attributes is based on record number. Attribute records in the
dBASE file must be in the same order as records in the main file.</li>
				<li>
					<i>sbn</i> -- Part 1 of spatial index for read-write instances of the Shapefile format.  If present, essential for correct processing.</li>
				<li>
					<i>sbx</i> -- Part 2 of spatial index for read-write instances of the Shapefile format.  If present, essential for correct processing.</li>
				<li>
					<i>atx</i> -- Created by ArcView 3.x for each instance of the Shapefile format or dBASE attribute index created in ArcCatalog.  ArcView GIS 3.x attribute indexes for shapefiles and dBASE files are not used by later versions of ArcGIS as a new attribute indexing model has been developed for shapefiles and dBASE files.  </li>
				<li>
					<i>fbn</i> -- One of the files that store the spatial index of the features for instances of the Shapefile format that are read-only.</li>
				<li>
					<i>fbx</i> -- The other file (besides .fbn) that stores the spatial index of the features for instances of the Shapefile format that are read-only. </li>
				<li>
					<i>ain</i> -- One of the files that stores the attribute index of the active fields in a table or a theme&apos;s attribute table.</li>
				<li>
					<i>aih</i> -- The other file (besides .ain) that stores the attribute index of the active fields in a table or a theme&apos;s attribute table</li>
				<li>
					<i>ixs</i> -- Geocoding index for read/write shapefiles.   If present, essential for correct processing. </li>
				<li>
					<i>mxs</i> --Geocoding index for read-write shapefiles (ODB format).</li>
				<li>
					<i>prj</i> -- Projections Definition file; stores coordinate system information.</li>
				<li>
					<i>xml</i> -- contains metadata, as used by ArcGIS.</li>
				<li>
					<i>cpg</i> -- An optional file that can be used to specify the codepage for identifying the character set to be used.  </li>
			</ul>

		<fdd:experience>The Library of Congress has acquired geospatial data in Shapefile format for its collections and to produce maps to support service to the U.S. Congress and to illustrate the scope of collections.  Where the Library once acquired ongoing map sets on paper, many are now acquired digitally.  For example, a map acquisition may include both a <fddLink id="fdd000279">GeoTIFF</fddLink> created by scanning a paper map and vectorizations of the original as ESRI_shape or <fddLink id="fdd000294">GeoDB_file</fddLink> format.  From various sources, including archived web pages, over 160,000 files with .shp extension were found in its digital collection storage in May 2024.</fdd:experience>
		<fdd:preference>For works acquired for its collections, the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/preservation/resources/rfs/geo-carto.html">Library of Congress Recommended Format Specifications for Geographic Information System (GIS) - Vector Data</a>, indicates that the Shapefile format, ESRI_Shape, is a preferred format for GIS vector data.  Since ESRI_Shape is supported by widely adopted geospatial information systems and by well supported open source software libraries, it is also a preferred format for geospatial datasets.

		<fdd:adoption>
			<p>During the 1990s, Esri introduced the Shapefile format and it soon became a de facto standard. The format is still widely deployed today, although the limitations outlined in the <a href="#factors">Quality and functionality factors</a> and <a href="#notes">Notes</a> within this description have led many users to move to geospatial database formats.  See <fddLink id="fdd000293">GeoDB</fddLink> and <fddLink id="fdd000520">GeoPackage</fddLink>.</p>
			<p>According to <a href="https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0005repo/geographic-information.html#shapefiles">Shapefiles</a> in the online course &quot;CASA0005 Geographic Information Systems and Science&quot; from University College, London, &quot;Perhaps the most commonly used GIS data format is the shapefile. Shapefiles were developed by ESRI, one of the first and now certainly the largest commercial GIS company in the world. Despite being developed by a commercial company, they are mostly an open format and can be used (read and written) by a host of GIS Software applications.&quot;</p>
			<p>Essentially all GIS applications can view, use, or manipulate data in the Shapefile format.  In early 2020, examples of mainstream geospatial software applications supporting the Shapefile format, with links to lists of supported formats, include: <a href="https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/data/shapefiles/working-with-shapefiles-in-arcgis-pro.htm">Esri ArcGIS</a> and other Esri products, such as <a href="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/cityengine/latest/help/help-import-shapefile.htm">CityEngine</a>; <a href="https://www.bluemarblegeo.com/knowledgebase/global-mapper-21-1/Formats/Shapefile.htm">Global Mapper</a>; <a href="https://bynder.hexagon.com/m/19643d4143db49a5/original/Hexagon_GSP_LuciadFusion_Brochure.pdf">LuciadFusion (from Hexagon Geospatial)</a>.  The open-source GIS application <a href="https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/user_manual/managing_data_source/supported_data.html?highlight=shapefile#esri-shapefile-format">QGIS</a> can import and export Shapefiles. Data streams, such as those from global positioning system (GPS) receivers, can also be stored in the Shapefile format. Shapefiles can be imported into <a href="https://www.google.com/earth/outreach/learn/importing-geographic-information-systems-gis-data-in-google-earth/#import-a-gis-shapefile-or-other-vector-dataset-1">Google Earth Pro</a>, <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Software_comparison/Import_a_shapefile">Open Street Map</a>, and <a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/autocad-map-3d/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2019/ENU/MAP3D-Use/files/GUID-B7686DD2-2F5D-4984-B023-14B13AA7E516-htm.html">AutoCAD Map 3D</a>.  There are also several software libraries, in a variety of programming languages that support its use.  In particular, the Open Source Geospatial Foundation&apos;s <a href="https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/shapefile.html">Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL)</a> supports the Shapefile format, and Safe Software&apos;s <a href="https://www.safe.com/integrate/arcgis-shp/">FME Desktop for integrating and transforming spatial data</a> supports read and write of the Shapefile format on Windows, Linux, and MacOS operating systems.  See <a href="https://www.safe.com/fme/tech-specs/">FME Technical Specifications</a> for FME Desktop and FME Server.</p>
			<p>A number of U.S. government agencies have distributed data in Shapefile format, including the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the U.S. Census Bureau, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the interagency National Atlas of the United States project led by USGS.  See <a href="#notes">Notes</a> for more detail on the Shapefile format data available from these agencies.</p>
			<p>Among the archival institutions that list the Shapefile format as a preferred or acceptable format are: the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/policy/transfer-guidance-tables.html#geospatialformats">U.S. National Archives</a>; the <a href="https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/manage-data/format/recommended-formats"> UK Data Service</a>; and the <a href="https://dans.knaw.nl/en/about/services/easy/information-about-depositing-data/before-depositing/file-formats">Data Archiving and Networked Services</a> for the Netherlands.</p>

				<b>Accessibility Features</b>
			</p>
			<p>Accessibility features for GIS data can be a complex combination of factors to support still images, 3D formats, and datasets. In general, this means data to alt text for images, content for screen readers to enable user interactivity events such as object selection, rotation and zoom, alt text for image forms, color contrast definition as well as caption and subtitle support as well as structured data to identify regions and grids on pages and defined relationships in tables. Depending on implementation, Shapefiles have the potential for good accessibility support. <a href="../contact_format.shtml">Comments welcome</a>.</p>

			<fdd:normalDataset>
				<p>The ESRI Shapefile format is a special-purpose dataset for storing nontopological geometry and attribute information for the spatial
features in a data set. Its component <fddLink id="fdd000326">Shape_DBF</fddLink> file uses a constrained form of the dBASE File Format (<fddLink id="fdd000325">DBF</fddLink>) to store feature attributes using a limited set of data types.</p>
				<p>Some relevant considerations were outlined in the Esri Help explanation <a href="http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisdesktop/9.3/index.cfm?TopicName=Geoprocessing_considerations_for_shapefile_output">&quot;Geoprocessing Considerations for Shapefile Output,&quot;</a> (as of 2009 and ArcGIS 9.3), including the idea that the relative simplicity of the Shapefile format's structure means that data may be lost if the format is used to transfer complex geometry and attributes.  The document also notes that the format's attributes cannot contain null values, and stores numeric values as characters rather than binary, thus leading to rounding errors for numbers containing decimal places, i.e., real numbers.  The format also lacks good support for Unicode character strings, thus limiting the use of non-English languages, and does not allow field names longer than ten characters. The format cannot store both a date and a time in the same date field, and cannot support spatial domains or subtypes.  In terms of geometry limitations, instances of the Shapefile format have a 2 GB size limitation for any of the component file, but any given instance may take up to three to five times as much space as file GIS databases. The Shapefile format does not contain an XY tolerance (the minimum distance between coordinates before they are considered equal), thus impacting the precision with which comparison between features can be calculated.  Since circular arc curves are not supported in the format, existing circular arc curves will be transformed to simple line features with closely spaced vertices rather than as true arcs.</p>
				<p>As of 2020, with increasing size of datasets and more GIS use and analysis by beginners and non-specialists, the shortcomings of the Shapefile format are increasingly significant.  Alternatives include the openly specified <fddLink id="fdd000520">OGC GeoPackage</fddLink> and the proprietary <fddLink id="fdd000294">ESRI File Geodatabase</fddLink>.  Examples of advocacy for stopping use of Shapefile, with lists of problems, include <a href="http://switchfromshapefile.org/">Switch from Shapefile</a> and <a href="https://www.gis-blog.com/geopackage-vs-shapefile/">Why you should use GeoPackage instead of Shapefile</a>.</p>
			</fdd:normalDataset>
			<fdd:accessSoftware>There are many non-Esri applications that can view, use and output instances of the Shapefile format, although the instances that are output can easily be corrupted, and may not be properly formatted.  Information about how to create data in the Shapefile format can be found within the <a href="http://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf">ESRI Shapefile Technical Description:
An ESRI White Paper—July 1998.</a>  Links to a free C library for reading and/or writing the Shapefile format, and an Open Source (MIT License) Python library for reading/writing in the format can be found in the <a href="#useful">Useful References</a> section.</fdd:accessSoftware>
			<fdd:dataDocumentation>The minimal requirements for an instance of the Shapefile format do not specify a place for the documentation of data quality or provenance.</fdd:dataDocumentation>
		</fdd:datasetQF>
		<fdd:gisQF>
			<fdd:normalGIS>
				<p>The minimal structure for the Shapefile format (i.e., the required .shp, .shx, .dbf files in the cluster)  facilitates georeferencing to the extent that &quot;auxiliary&quot; files are also clustered in the same directory structure, including a .prj file for projection information, and a .txt or .xml file for metadata.  If the metadata record for a given Shapefile format instance includes coordinates, datum, and scale, the location for the features represented by the instance of the format can be accurately and precisely determined.</p>
				<p>The Shapefile format handles single features that overlap or that are noncontiguous. The format can support point, line, and area features. Area features are represented as closed loop, double-digitized polygons.</p>
				<p>Because the format does not have the processing overhead of a topological data structure, it typically requires less disk space and is easier to read and write.   It has advantages over some more complex geospatial data formats such as faster drawing speed and editability. However, Shapefiles do not have a spatial domain, which defines the geographic extent that all coordinates must fall within. This spatial extent is useful when editing geometry since it prevents you from entering coordinates outside the extent.  See Normal Dataset and Notes for further limitations.</p>
			</fdd:normalGIS>
			<fdd:metadataGIS>When .txt or .xml files are included within the Shapefile cluster's directory, they are usually intended as metadata for the data contained within the other files that comprise the shapefile.  No assumptions are made about the completeness or accuracy of the metadata, nor is any particular content standard presumed.</fdd:metadataGIS>
			<fdd:grids>Instances of the Shapefile format are ready for grid analysis by virtue of the component <fddLink id="fdd000326">Shape_DBF</fddLink> file, essentially a relational database table.  This table contains the characteristics describing geographic features that are available for viewing and/or for simple grid analysis.  The extent to which mathematical and statistical calculations can be performed against the data in the table is dependent upon the data structure built into the dataset layers comprising the shapefile.   Often, the tabular data found in an instance of a Shapefile format are joined or related to other tabular data to support more complex analysis. </fdd:grids>

			<p>All file names in a Shapefile format cluster adhere to the 8.3 naming convention. The main file, the index file, and the
dBASE file have the same base filename (prefix), which must start with an alphanumeric character
(a–Z, 0–9), followed by zero or up to seven characters (a–Z, 0–9, _, -).  All letters in a file name are in lower case on operating systems with case
sensitive file names.  </p>
			<p>The Shapefile format stores integer and double-precision numbers.  The <a href="https://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf">ESRI Shapefile Technical Description</a> refers to the following types:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Integer: Signed 32-bit integer (4 bytes)</li>
				<li>Double: Signed 64-bit IEEE double-precision floating point number (8 bytes)</li>
				<li>Floating point numbers must be numeric values.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Positive infinity, negative infinity, and Not-a-Number (NaN) values are not allowed in the format. Nevertheless, the format supports the concept of &quot;no data&quot; values, but they are currently used only for measures.
Any floating point number smaller than –1038 is considered by a Shapefile reader to
represent a &quot;no data&quot; value.</p>
			<p>The functionality associated with the Shapefile format is constrained by the rules associated with the building and display of points, polylines, and polygons.  Limitations are also imposed by the use of the dBASE component file with its field types and character width restrictions, its restriction to support only for ANSI characters in field names and values. The number of fields within an attribute table are limited to 255, and there is little support for SQL functions other than that provided by use of WHERE clauses.  Feature class subtyping, assignment of attribute domains, geometric networks, topologies and annotations are not supported by shapefiles, thus more or less limiting functionality to that of normal GIS functionality. </p>
			<p>The Shapefile format can be useful as a middle state when exporting data for use in a non-Esri software application, or for exporting data to use in ArcView 3 or ArcInfo Workstation. The Shapefile format can be used to write simple features and attributes quickly, such as for ArcGIS Server geoprocessing services. But as is outlined in the Esri Help explanation <a href="http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisdesktop/9.3/index.cfm?TopicName=Geoprocessing_considerations_for_shapefile_output">Geoprocessing Considerations for Shapefile Output (from 2009, ArcGIS 9.3)</a>, the format does not handle the full life cycle of data creation, editing, versioning, and archiving, thus inhibiting its use in modern life-cycle, active database management.</p>
			<p>Listed here are examples of the adoption of the Shapefile format by U.S. government agencies.  Since government websites are reorganized and redesigned and use of formats changes over time, many of the links are via the Internet Archive:</p>

				<li>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140305131924/http://www.nationalatlas.gov/pros.html">National Atlas of the United States of America</a> vector file map layers were available in Shapefile format during the 1997-2014 period the Atlas was online.  These layers were formerly also available in the <fddLink id="fdd000301">SDTS-TVP</fddLink> format, but SDTS-TVP support was dropped in mid-2012, because of lack of demand.</li>
				<li>In 2014, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140413075909/http://ned.usgs.gov/downloads.html">National Elevation Dataset (NED) Spatial Metadata</a> was available in Shapefile format. (Link via Internet Archive)</li>
				<li>The United States Census Bureau has made datasets of legal boundaries available in Shapefile format for many years.  See, for example, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120321221432/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/prev_cartbndry_names.html">Pre-2010 Cartographic Boundary File Naming Conventions</a> (as of 2012) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170829042711/https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html">TIGER/Line Shapefiles</a> (as of 2017). In May 2020, legal boundary data is still available in Shapefile format; see <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/technical-documentation/complete-technical-documentation.html">Census Geography Program: Combined Documentation</a>.</li>
				<li>Several datasets available as layers in The National Map (<a href="https://viewer.nationalmap.gov/basic/">TNM</a>) can be downloaded in Shapefile and <fddLink id="fdd000294">GeoDB_file</fddLink> formats.  This includes the <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/usgs-national-boundary-dataset-nbd-downloadable-data-collectionbc141">USGS National Boundary Dataset</a>, the <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/usgs-national-transportation-dataset-ntd-downloadable-data-collectionde7d2">USGS National Transportation Dataset</a>, and the <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/usgs-national-structures-dataset-nsd-downloadable-data-collection-national-geospatial-data-ass">USGS National Structures Dataset</a>.</li>

					<a href="https://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/data/us-maritime-limits-and-boundaries.html#access-digital-data">U.S. Maritime Limits &amp; Boundaries</a>, from Office of Coast Survey are distributed in Shapefile format.</li>
				<li>The United States Environmental Protection Agency distributed geospatial information from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151011044005/http://www2.epa.gov/enviro/geospatial-data-download-service">Facility Registry Service (FRS)</a> as Shapefiles until 2015 (Link via Internet Archive).  More recently, the same data is made available instead in <fddLink id="fdd000294">GeoDB_file</fddLink> format.  See <a href="https://www.epa.gov/frs/geospatial-data-download-service">FRS | Geospatial Data Download Service</a>.</li>
				<li>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) distributes <a href="https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/datasets.php">Forest Service National Datasets</a> in Shapefile format.</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://shoreline.noaa.gov/data/datasheets/usgs.html">Vector Shoreline data</a> originating from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) are available from NOAA in Shapefile format.</li>
				<li>Data from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180719025826/http://www.broadbandmap.gov/data-download">National Broadband Map</a> (as of 2014) was available in Shapefile and <fddLink id="fdd000323">CSV</fddLink> formats. (Link via Internet Archive)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Shapefiles are often distributed as compressed packages that combine the related files and reduce download time.  The <a href="http://www.bluemarblegeo.com/products/global-mapper-dlvg32.php">USGS Digital Data Viewer: dlgv32 Pro</a> a limited-feature version of commercial software <a href="http://www.bluemarblegeo.com/products/global-mapper.php/">Global Mapper</a>, can load directly Shapefiles distributed as compressed .tar.gz files.</p>

		<fdd:history>
			<p>Esri introduced the Shapefile format as a part of ArcView GIS version 2 during the 1990s. The format was welcome because interest in simple geometric structures had grown during the 1990s as disk storage and hardware costs decreased and computational speed increased. At the same time, existing geographic information system (GIS) datasets were more readily available, and the work of GIS users was evolving from primarily data compilation activities to include data use, analysis, and data sharing. Shapefiles could be easily created from many GIS systems and, over time, shapefiles were widely adopted as a de facto standard.</p>
