The documentation is based on the document <a href="https://developer.blender.org/diffusion/B/browse/master/doc/blender_file_format/mystery_of_the_blend.html">The Mystery of the Blend</a>, June 2010, written by Jeroen Bakker, using a default BLEND file from Blender 2.48 as a working example.</p>			<p>BLEND files organize data in various data-blocks, such as objects, meshes, or materials. The data-blocks can be linked together and referred to each other within the same BLEND file or other BLEND files creating reusable resource libraries. </p>			<p>				<b>Global File Structure of BLEND</b>			</p>			<ul>				<li>File-Header: the first 12 bytes of every BLEND file is the file-header. It has information on Blender version and the platform the BLEND file was save on (pointer-size and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">endianness</a>, which is required because all data in the BLEND file is ordered that way and no translation or transformations is done during saving. Endianness addresses the way values are ordered in a sequence of bytes. Blender supports little-endian and little-endian, but note that endianness can be different between the BLEND file and the platform being used.</li>				<li>File-Block: contains a file-block-header that describes the total length of the data, the type of information stored, the number of items of the information, and the old memory address pointer. </li>				<li>Structure DNA: stored in a file-block with code ‘DNA1’ and contains all internal structures of the Blender release the file was created in. The structures are stored in 4 arrays: Names, Types, Lengths, and Structures. Each Structure contains an array of fields, a combination of a type and a name, and from this information a catalog of all the structures can be constructed. Types include simple-types, integer, char, and float, but also complex-types, Scene or MetaBall. </li>			</ul>			<p>BLEND files save data in-memory to disk without any translations or transformations, it only adds file-block-headers to the data which contain information on how to interpret the data. Blender structures are stored after the data with the structures acting as blue-prints when the BLEND file is loaded. </p>			<p>				<a href="https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Tools/Tips_for_Coding_Blender#:~:text=Blender%20is%20coded%20in%203,we%20will%20focus%20on%20that.">Blender</a> is coded in 3 languages, C, C++, and Python, with Python used as an internal scripting language.

Free to Change. Free to Share. Free to Sell Your Work. The output of Blender, in the form of BLEND files, is considered program output, and the sole copyright of the user. The BLEND file format only stores data definitions. </p>		</fdd:licensingAndPatents>		<fdd:transparency>			<p>Low Support. A BLEND 3D model is a special file format by Blender and should only be edited and saved with the appropriate software. BLEND files are binary files, Blender saves its data as BLEND files and can only open BLEND files. Other 3D file types are not “opened,” but imported. </p>		</fdd:transparency>		<fdd:selfDocumentation>			<p>The BLEND file format is not a true file interchange format, rather it dumps internal data structures directly from memory to disk. A BLEND file’s structure may therefore be unique to each version of Blender. Despite this, BLEND files are both backward and forward compatible between versions, and between different hardware and operating systems. This is made possible by the addition of metadata, known as Struct DNA, that allows conversion when loading the file. </p>			<p>“DNA” or “SDNA” (“structure” DNA”) is the system for mapping Blender’s in-memory data structures to the on-disk BLEND file format. A saved BLEND file includes a detailed description of the layout of all the data structures saved in the file, and this description is stored in the “DNA1” block at the end. This block is generated by the makesdna tool, which is built and run automatically as part of the overall build process, so its output can be included directly into the Blender executable. </p>		</fdd:selfDocumentation>		<fdd:externalDependencies>BLEND files can be handled with the Blender program, which is available for free from the Blender Organization website. Most of Blender's BLEND files are forward, backward, and cross-platform compatible with other versions of Blender. A wide variety of import/export scripts that extend Blender capabilities (accessing the object data via an internal API) make it possible to interoperate with other 3D tools. </fdd:externalDependencies>		<fdd:techProtection>			<p>None.</p>		</fdd:techProtection>	</fdd:sustainabilityFactors>	<fdd:qualityAndFunctionalityFactors>		<fdd:otherQF>			<fdd:factor>				<fdd:tag>3D Model Geometry</fdd:tag>				<fdd:note>					<p>In <a href="https://all3dp.com/2/blender-nurbs-modeling/">Blender, 3D models</a> can be built with different object types such as a mesh, curve, surface, metaball, text, grease pencil, armature, lattice, image, and camera. Some types of modeling in Blender are polygonal mesh modeling and curve-based modeling. Meshes are the most common type of modeling object used in Blender. Bézier and NURBS curves, defining curves through a mathematical formula, are the basic curve-based forms included in Blender. </p>					<p>Users can use Blender’s built-in sculpting tools to add detail directly to the model’s surface. Sculpting uses tools to ’push’ and ‘pull’ the mesh in different ways, working best when there are a lot of polygons and is generally used to create highly detailed and textured objects.</p>				</fdd:note>			</fdd:factor>			<fdd:factor>				<fdd:tag>3D Model Appearance</fdd:tag>				<fdd:note>					<p>BLEND supports <a href="https://all3dp.com/2/blender-uv-mapping-simply-explained/">UV mapping</a>, mapping 2D textures on 3D objects, a process done in a UV editor.

Uses can adjust opacity, diffusion, light reflection, or back-lighting.</p>					<p>						<a href="https://all3dp.com/2/blender-how-to-add-a-texture/">BLEND materials</a> are composed on image textures, textures being images or patterns only and materials are collections of information that defines an object’s color, shininess, transparency, and/or bumpiness. Materials can contain multiple textures that alter the overall look, and objects can have multiple materials assigned to different parts, making simple objects look more complex, the primary advantage of image textures.</p>				</fdd:note>			</fdd:factor>			<fdd:factor>				<fdd:tag>3D Model Scene</fdd:tag>				<fdd:note>					<p>Each <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/scene_layout/scene/introduction.html">BLEND file</a> can contain multiple scenes, which can share and link to other scenes, objects, and/or materials.

Cameras are invisible to renders, so there is no material or texture settings. </p>					<p>Blender supports a variety of <a href="https://all3dp.com/2/blender-lighting-simply-explained/">“lamp” types</a> that emit light into a scene, including sun, point, spot, and area.

It stores a copy of the previously saved version of the currently opened .BLEND file and is used for recovering the previous version of a BLEND file. BLEND1 files can be renamed with the ".blend" extension and opened normally. BLEND1 files may be accompanied by other ".blend2," ".blend3," etc. files. These files are generated based on the number of allowed save backups the user specifies in the application preferences.

The pickle module implements binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure. “Pickling” is the process whereby a Python object hierarchy is converted into a byte stream, and “unpickling” is the inverse operation, whereby a byte stream (from a binary file or bytes-like object) is converted back into an object hierarchy.    </p>		</fdd:general>		<fdd:history>			<p>				<a href="https://www.blender.org/about/history/">Blender</a> was created by Ton Roosendaal, a Dutch art director and self-taught software developer. Roosendaal started his own 3D animation studio, NeoGeo, in 1989. Initially based in Roosendaal’s attic, NeoGeo grew rapidly, garnering awards and becoming the biggest company of its type in the Netherlands. Roosendaal wrote the first source files titled “Blender” on the 2nd of January, 1994, still considered Blender’s official birthday. Originally, Blender was planned as an in-house application for NeoGeo; it grew from a series of pre-existing tools. Blender 1.0 was launched in January 1995. When NeoGeo was closed, Roosendaal partnered with Frank van Beek and founded a new company focused on further developing and marketing Blender. Not a Number (NaN) opened its doors in June 1998, distributing Blender under a freemium pricing strategy: the software was free to download, with NaN selling keys to unlock more advanced features. Despite investments, troubled relations between NaN and its investors meant that the company closed in early 2002. With NaN’s demise, Blender’s development ceased, unable to buy the rights from NaN’s backers. In May of 2002, Roosendaal started a non-profit, the Blender Foundation, with the intention of making Blender open-source. In May of 2002, Roosendaal started a non-profit, the Blender Foundation, with the intention of making Blender open-source. In July, Roosendaal launched the first-ever crowdfunding campaign: Free Blender. Thanks to Blender’s community of 250,000 users, the Blender Foundation was able to raise one hundred and ten thousand euros in just seven weeks — sufficient to regain Blender from its investors. On Sunday, October 13th, 2002, Blender was released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, the strictest possible open-source contract. </p>		</fdd:history>	</fdd:notes>	<fdd:formatSpecifications/>	<fdd:usefulReferences>		<fdd:urls>			<fdd:url>				<fdd:urlGroup>					<fdd:intro>Blender.org https://www.blender.org/</fdd:intro>					<fdd:urlList>						<fdd:urlReference>							<link>https://www.blender.org/about/history/</link>							<tag>History</tag>						</fdd:urlReference>						<fdd:urlReference>							<link>https://www.blender.org/about/license/</link>							<tag>License</tag>						</fdd:urlReference>						<fdd:urlReference>							<link>https://www.blender.org/support/faq/#using-blender-7</link>							<tag>FAQs</tag>						</fdd:urlReference>						<fdd:urlReference>							<link>https://www.blender.org/news/blender-by-the-numbers-2020/#:~:text=In%202020%20Blender%20has%20been,increase%20across%20all%20operating%20systems</link>							<tag>Blender by the Numbers – 2020</tag>						</fdd:urlReference>					</fdd:urlList>				</fdd:urlGroup>			</fdd:url>			<fdd:url>				<fdd:urlReference>					<link>https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/index.html </link>					<tag>Blender 3.4 ManualX</tag>				</fdd:urlReference>			</fdd:url>			<fdd:url>				<fdd:urlReference>					<link>https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Main_Page</link>					<tag>Blender Developer Wiki</tag>				</fdd:urlReference>			</fdd:url>			<fdd:url>				<fdd:urlReference>					<link>https://archive.blender.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page/</link>					<tag>Archive Blender Wiki</tag>				</fdd:urlReference>			</fdd:url>			<fdd:url>				<fdd:urlReference>					<link>https://www.blendernation.com/</link>					<tag>BlenderNation.com</tag>				</fdd:urlReference>			</fdd:url>			<fdd:url>				<fdd:urlReference>					<link>https://all3dp.com/2/blender-simply-explained/</link>					<tag>All3DP - BLEND Files</tag>				</fdd:urlReference>			</fdd:url>			<fdd:url>				<fdd:urlReference>					<link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blender_(software)#File_format</link>					<tag>Wikipedia - Blender (software)</tag>				</fdd:urlReference>			</fdd:url>			<fdd:url>				<fdd:urlReference>					<link>https://fileinfo.com/extension/blend</link>					<tag>FileInfo.com - BLEND File Extension</tag>				</fdd:urlReference>			</fdd:url>			<fdd:url>				<fdd:urlReference>					<link>https://filext.com/file-extension/BLEND</link>					<tag>FileExt.com - BLEND File</tag>				</fdd:urlReference>			</fdd:url>		</fdd:urls>	</fdd:usefulReferences></fdd:FDD>
